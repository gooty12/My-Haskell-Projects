# Santorini 
Santorini is a board game played by two players (or more) in turns. The official rules and guidelines can be found [here](https://roxley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Santorini-Rulebook-Web-2016.08.14.pdf).

The aim of this project is to learn functional programming and Haskell by implementing this board game.
